# odin-recipes

This was my first project for the Odin project.

The goal here was to build a bare bones HTML site with the correct boiler plate, and utilize basic elements such as Paragraphs, Headings, and both unordered and ordered lists. The Homepage links to other pages and the file directory is organized using best practices.
